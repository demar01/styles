> Ana Fullerene is an experience researcher that works in a proteomics facility. She has two kids and large workload. She has good statistical understanding and intermediate programing experience, as she does some data wrangling in R and plotting with ggplot2. 

The proteomics facility is getting more busy in the past years; Ana is looking for new methods how she can handle the data more effectively.  She knows there are better methods in place to handle the large amount of datasets, but she hadn't had the chance to learn them yet. 

Software Carpentry will teach Ana the basic of QFeatures - a Bioconductor object system for proteomics. She will understand the architecture of this object, build a QFeature object with her own data and use available resources that uses this type of obejct to automate her to work.
